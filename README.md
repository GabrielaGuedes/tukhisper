## ‚ö†Ô∏è Platform Notes

- **Tested on Ubuntu Linux.** For other Linux distributions or macOS, you may need to adjust system dependencies and paths.
- **On macOS:** Install system dependencies with Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg portaudio
  ```
- **First run:** The app will download the Whisper model weights, which may take a few minutes and requires an internet connection.
- **Clipboard:** If clipboard integration does not work, ensure you are running in a graphical session and have `xclip` or `xsel` installed.

  python3 src/transcriber_tray.py
  ```
- **From the built executable:**
  ```bash
  ./dist/transcriber_tray
  ```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è .desktop File

- If you use the built executable, set the `Exec=` line in your `.desktop` file to:
  ```
  Exec=/full/path/to/dist/transcriber_tray
  ```
